This git repositories features algorithms ideas that I learned in class and coded in python.

List of algorithms:
    divide and conquer:
        mergesort.py
            an mergesort algorithm that sorts the array in O(nlogn)
        inversion.py
            an algorithm that sorts the array and count the inversions within the array
            an inversion is defined as A[i] > A[j] and i < j
            uses divide and conquer to find number of total inversions
        peak.py
            an algorithm that guarantees to find a peak point in an array of size greater than zero
            and has distinct elements
